# Square equation solver

## How it works
When you run it it asks if you will use it or no. *And asks you every solved equation*.<br>

Type of equation is: **ax^2 + bx + c = 0**<br>
Then it asks for coefficients a, b, c and then it gives you answers.<br>

If you launch programm from command line, you can type in "-h" as an argument to get path to .exe file<br>

## Features
1. You can not type in something that doesn't fit
    * You can not give to some functions double value that is not finite
2. Unit tests are included in code. To turn on debug mode you need to uncomment `#define DEBUG` in main programm

## Unit tests
You can make your own test for programm. You should make a new line in tests.txt. Example of lines:<br>
|a|b|c|num|x1|x2|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|5|4|2|-4|-1|
|1|0|-1|2|-1|1|
|0|1|1|1|-1||
|0|0|0|-1|||

in txt file it looks like<br>
1 5 4 2 -4 -1<br>
1 0 -1 2 -1 1<br>
0 1 1 1 -1<br>
0 0 0 -1<br>
